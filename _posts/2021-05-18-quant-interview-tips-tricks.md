In spite of the adverse job market conditions \**cough\** pandemic \**cough\**, quite a number of people these days are looking to get quantitative finance related jobs. Having gone through a reasonable number of interviews myself, I'll share some pointers about what I believe is important to keep in mind.

- With the risk of sounding boring, I will say **prepare, prepare, prepare!** It is really important to be "warmed up" for the kind of brainteasers/math problems that you will definitely encounter on these interviews. Imagine it's a math competition, because it is. People who did competitive math/CS/physics/anything, really, will know the importance of being on point with their problem-solving skills. Take 2 months at least, of preparing for 3-4 hours a day. **At least!**

- Research the role you are applying for. Some roles will be more math-heavy, some will be more programming-heavy, but you will almost certaingly need at least a bit of both. Tailoring your prep properly will save you a ton of time while making it considerably more effective.

- The company is equally as important, too. Company culture dictates a lot of their recruitment style. Focused research companies like *Two Sigma* or *Citadel* will ask in-depth questions, while more generalist companies like *Jump* will ask for more breadth. *Jane Street* is its own animal here. 


Finally, listing some resources here. You do not have to go through all of them, rather make a tailored prep program that lets you ace the specific kind of interview you need for your dream job.
- A [good Git repo](https://github.com/kojino/120-Data-Science-Interview-Questions) with various problems.
- A personal [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ycirr4w2p3u5y5h/AADJ0xFpQ5pjn7iUQFtvA-R8a?dl=0) with some books and questions. It is a work in progress, if you want to add anything else please send them over!
