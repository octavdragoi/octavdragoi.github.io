In spite of the adverse job market conditions \**cough\** pandemic \**cough\**, quite a number of people these days are looking to get quantitative finance related jobs. Having gone through a reasonable number of interviews myself, I'll share some pointers about what I believe is important to keep in mind.

- With the risk of sounding boring, I will say **prepare, prepare, prepare!** It is really important to be "warmed up" for the kind of brainteasers/math problems that you will definitely encounter on these interviews. Imagine it's a math competition, because it is. People who did competitive math/CS/physics/anything, really, will know the importance of being on point with their problem-solving skills. Take 2 months at least, of preparing for 3-4 hours a day. **At least!**

- Research the role you are applying for. Some roles will be more math-heavy, some will be more programming-heavy, but you will almost certaingly need at least a bit of both. Tailoring your prep properly will save you a ton of time while making it considerably more effective.

- The company is equally as important, too. Company culture dictates a lot of their recruitment style. Focused research companies like *Two Sigma*, *Citadel*, *G-Research* will ask in-depth abstract questions, while more generalist companies like *Jump*, *Tower* or most small boutique shops will ask for more breadth. *Jane Street* is its own animal here, with their love of poker games and game theory oriented brainteasers.

- Practice interviews. Schedule some that you do not care for as much first, as practice, and save the best for last. It really makes a difference, you will climb the improvement curve surprisingly quickly.

- How to find companies: if you are in a highly prestigious college, you are in luck, the companies will come on campus to you. Otherwise, or if you are applying post-college, it is more difficult. I would recommend surfing through LinkedIn and finding company openings, recruiters, or even independent headhunters (see my thoughts on them below). **Also,** do not forget about various events that companies might host: hackathons, competitions, whatever. It is a good way to get a sense of the company and make your resume land where it should.

- On headhunters: I used one only once, and it was a pleasant experience. He managed to land me the job that I am currently working for, and I doubt I would have gotten on this particular team without him. Some can have great connections, but I also have the feeling that it is a gamble in terms of their quality. My advice is, use your guts and read the person; if you click well with them, then proceed with caution, otherwise stop.

- Glassdoor is a wonderful resource. You can usually get a good sense about the particularities of an interview process for a specific firm or role from there. Also, there are occasionally some good interview questions.

- For college students trying to get an internship: it will be an uphill battle to get anything before junior year. Very few companies take anyone who is a freshman or sophomore, no matter how good they are, and those companies are **very** competitive. So, either try to find a niche company that takes younger people, or be patient, do some research program, and prepare really well for your junior year interviews.

- For returnees: the process of applying as an experienced hire differs somewhat. You will be asked much more about how to deal with common issues on the job, rather than brainteasers. Think things like "you have a signal and it's not working properly, what do you look for?" and other similar things. However, practice is equally as important!

Finally, listing some resources here. You do not have to go through all of them, rather make a tailored prep program that lets you ace the specific kind of interview you need for your dream job.
- A [good Git repo](https://github.com/kojino/120-Data-Science-Interview-Questions) with various problems.
- A personal [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ycirr4w2p3u5y5h/AADJ0xFpQ5pjn7iUQFtvA-R8a?dl=0) with some books and questions. It is a work in progress, if you want to add anything else please send them over!
- [This book here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/david-morin/green-eyed-dragons) is awesome! Work through it, it has many of the classical statistics problems that you really need to know for this. Shout out to Prof. Morin for such a great overview of some of the best statistics and other math problems out there.
