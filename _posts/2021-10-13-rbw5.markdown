Live, from the Heidelberg Castle, we had what must undoubtedly have been the best AoE2 tournament yet. Awesome matches, solid prizes, and what a great atmosphere to have everyone together in such a place!

The snake king TheViper is back, too, winning what would have been definitely a difficult series for anyone, and even moreso for his hurt wrist.

Of course, all players deserve a huge shoutout for putting up what has been an Earth-shattering competition. And a huge thank you to all the production people and the casters; thanks Membo for continuing to entertain us.
