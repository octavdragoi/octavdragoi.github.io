Wanted to congratulate all the people involved in this project, and thank Red Bull for their support. With such high-quality tournaments, the AOE2:DE community is growing into a full-fledged esport soon enough!

Congratulations Liereyy for winning the big trophy, what a ride you had! That second match with Vinchester was a legendary one.

And it has been great to see Memb casting a high-level tournament; I think he did a great job. membStradamus on point as always, ayayay.
