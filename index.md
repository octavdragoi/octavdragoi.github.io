This is a place where I will write thoughts, ideas that I find interesting, silly things every once in a while, and practice my writing skills in the meanwhile.

You might find contents regarding math, programming, finance, quant finance, general tech, life in London, cycling, Age of Empires II, and whatever else is on my mind at the moment.

It might become bilingual. Or trilingual.

Anyway, să aveți viel Spaß, друзья!
